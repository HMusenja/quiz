## Summary of Key Methods and Concepts:
### import:
 Used to include external modules (inquirer for CLI interaction and fs/promises for reading files).
### async/await:
 Asynchronous functions are used to handle file reading and user prompts without blocking execution.
### inquirer.prompt():
 A method that displays interactive prompts in the terminal for user input.
### fs.readFile():
 Asynchronous file reading function that loads the quiz questions.
### Fisher-Yates Shuffle:
 A well-known algorithm for randomizing arrays.
 The for loop iterates through the array from the last element down to the first.
For each element, a random index j is selected, and the elements at positions i and j are swapped.
This ensures a uniformly random shuffle.
### Looping and Conditional Logic:
 Used to iterate through questions, check answers, and calculate the score.
